Resolving dependencies...
Bundler could not find compatible versions for gem "rack":
  In snapshot (Gemfile.lock):
    rack (= 2.0.1.1.forked)

  In Gemfile:
    rack (= 2.0.1.1.forked)

    rack-obama was resolved to 0.1.1, which depends on
      rack

Running `bundle update` will rebuild your snapshot from scratch, using only
the gems in your Gemfile, which may resolve the conflict.
